# Comparison of Mask RCNN vs Yolov8
- The goal of this assignment is train both models on custom annotated dataset.

- Take photos of your environment of two or more objects. (at least 100 instances between all objects)

- Annotate them on roboflow.

- Train a Mask RCNN model using detectron2

- Train Yolov8 the smallest size

- Evaluate both models based on mAP and speed and size.

# Taking pictures
A notebook and airpods were used for segmentation task
